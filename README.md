# ADA-Staking
Cardano (ADA) Staking Pool

A truly decentralized staking pool with a hybrid solution implementing a block producer and a main relay node in a basement server in Zurich (powered with renewable energy) and a backup relay on a data center in Germany.

Hosted in Switzerland and Germany and operated by a cool vegan software engineer. 

We use ASUS Mini PCs with 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD.

GranADA monthly helps refugee families in countries with humanitarian crisis by contributing to the World Food Programm

Thank you for your trust and for joining the blockchain revolution!
