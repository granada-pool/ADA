# ADA Staking
Cardano Stake Pool


A truly decentralized stake pool operated by [@LaPetiteADA](https://twitter.com/lapetiteada) and a cool vegan software engineer with a hybrid solution implementing a block producer and a main relay node on private bare-metal servers in Zurich, Switzerland (powered with renewable energy) and a backup relay on a private data center in Germany. This pool uses ASUS Mini PCs PN40 with 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD, which consume as little as 6.4W at idle.

We strive to sustainibly decentralize the Cardano ecosystem

GranADA is an active member of the [Climate Neutral Cardano Group](https://www.climateneutralcardano.org/) and we donate 25% of our staking rewards to the [CNC Ala](https://climateneutralcardano.org/cnc-ala-ispo/). We also help refugee families in countries with humanitarian crisis by monthly supporting to the [World Food Programm](https://sharethemeal.org/en/table.html).

Thank you for your trust and for supporting sustainability with us!
